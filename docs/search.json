    "text": "Task 1: Conceptual Questions\n\nWhat is the purpose of the lapply() function? What is the equivalent purrr function?\n\n\nA: We use lapply() to apply function to lists. lapply() also returns a list. The equivalent purrr function is map().\n\n\nSuppose we have a list called my_list. Each element of the list is a numeric data frame (all columns are numeric). We want use lapply() to run the code cor(numeric_matrix, method = “kendall”) on each element of the list. Write code to do this below! (I’m really trying to ask you how you specify method = “kendall” when calling lapply())\n\n\nA: lapply(my_list, function(x) cor(x, method = “kendall”))\n\n\nWhat are two advantages of using purrr functions instead of the BaseR apply family?\n\n\nA: The main advantages of using purr functions instead of the BaseR apply family is more consistency and some helper functions.\n\n\nWhat is a side-effect function?\n\n\nA: Side-effect function modify some state but don’t naturally return the modified argument, such as print(), write_csv().\n\n\nWhy can you name a variable sd in a function and not cause any issues with the sd function?\n\n\nA: When you call a function, it creates temporary function environments. This is why variable in functions don’t exist outside the function.\n\n\n\nTask 2 - Writing R Functions\n\nWrite a basic function (call it getRMSE()) that takes in a vector of responses and a vector of predictions and outputs the RMSE.\n\n\n#write a function using the RMSE formula with additional argument in mean function to removes the NA values in the computation\ngetRMSE &lt;- function(resp, pred, ...){\n  mean &lt;- mean(sum((resp - pred)^2, ...), ...)\n  RMSE &lt;- sqrt(mean)\n  return(RMSE)\n}\n\n\nRun the following code to create some response values and predictions.\n\n\nTest the RMSE function using this data.\n\n\nset.seed(10)\nn &lt;- 100\nx &lt;- runif(n)\nresp &lt;- 3 + 10*x + rnorm(n)\npred &lt;- predict(lm(resp ~ x), data.frame(x))\n#supply the above resp and pred vectors in the getRMSE function with response_vector=resp and prediction_vector=pred\ngetRMSE(resp, pred)\n\n[1] 9.581677\n\n\n\nTest the RMSE function with and without specifying the behavior to deal with missing values.\n\n\n#create a new vector by replacing the 99th and 100th element in x with NA\nx_with_na &lt;- x\nx_with_na[99:100] &lt;- NA_real_\nx_with_na\n\n  [1] 0.50747820 0.30676851
